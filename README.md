# Human Ground Reaction Force Data Acquisition System 

Code used for my Master's thesis project. 

## üéØ Problem Description

The distribution of forces applied under the foot has long been a subject of great interest, mainly due to its usefulness in gait studies related to understanding the mechanisms involved in human locomotion, as well as in the identification and monitoring of issues that affect foot shape.

## üõ†Ô∏è Proposed solution

A double support posture analysis system was proposed based on insoles, using force-sensitive resistive sensors and other easily accessible electronic components.

## ‚ú® Main results

The system allows the evaluation of reaction forces present during the user's support posture, providing accurate information about the loads borne under key anatomical points on the sole of the foot.
- Individual load quantification up to 15 kg at each analysis point.
- Force estimations with satisfactory accuracy, exhibiting a maximum error of approximately 20%.
- In general, the system is estimated to capture approximately 40% of the total forces exerted by the user during double support stance.
